# Product Requirements Document (PRD): "This Day in History"

## 1. Project Overview
**Project Name:** This Day in History (Vedic Edition)  
**Description:** A mobile-friendly web application that maps historical events from the last 1500 years to Vedic astronomical signatures. The app aims to identify and highlight recurring patterns in history based on planetary combinations.

---

## 2. Objectives
* To provide a unique lens on history using **Vedic astronomical calculations**.
* To identify correlations between significant historical events and astrological patterns.
* To offer a highly customizable user experience through advanced filtering of astronomical data.

---

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Historical Event Mapping
* **1500-Year Database:** A comprehensive repository of significant historical events.
* **Astro-Tagging:** Each event is automatically linked to the planetary positions (Transits) at the time and location of its occurrence.

### 3.2 Vedic Calculation Engine
The app will calculate and display the following for any historical date:
* **Rashis:** The signs occupied by the planets.
* **Nakshatras:** The lunar mansions for each planet.
* **Conjunctions:** Multiple planets occupying the same Rashi.
* **Relative Aspects (Drishti):** Planetary influences and relationships between different houses/signs.

### 3.3 Advanced Filtering & Discovery
Users can customize their view based on specific astronomical criteria:
* **Combination Filters:** Search for events that occurred during specific conjunctions (e.g., Saturn-Mars conjunctions).
* **Transit Patterns:** Filter by specific planetary transits through certain Rashis or Nakshatras.
* **Event Categories:** Filter by the type of historical event (e.g., battles, coronations, discoveries).

### 3.4 Mobile-Friendly Web Interface
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both mobile browsers and desktop viewing.
* **Interactive Timeline:** A scrollable interface to explore history chronologically or by "astrological similarity."

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Backend
* **Vedic Library:** Integration with high-precision libraries (like Swiss Ephemeris) adapted for Vedic (Sidereal) ayanamshas.
* **API Layer:** To serve historical data and corresponding planetary calculations.

### 4.2 Frontend
* **Framework:** A modern, lightweight framework (e.g., React or FastAPI-driven frontend) ensuring fast load times on mobile.
* **Data Visualization:** Clean, intuitive icons for planets, signs, and aspects.

---

## 5. User Stories
* *As a history enthusiast,* I want to see which historical events happened when Jupiter was in its exaltation sign.
* *As a researcher,* I want to filter the last 1500 years of history to see if major wars coincide with specific Rahu/Ketu transits.
* *As a casual user,* I want to open the app and see "This Day in History" along with the Vedic chart of that specific day.

---

## 6. Future Scope
* **Predictive Modeling:** Using historical patterns to highlight upcoming dates with similar astronomical signatures.
* **User Contributions:** Allowing users to suggest historical events to be added to the database.
